To improve for performance, we implemented non-blocking event handling using gevent. Greenlets- the unit of execution for a gevent server, simulates multithreading and thereby significantly improved the performance of the server.

1. We noted that as we increased the number of concurrent connections (-c), the Apache benchmark turned rather non-deterministic between 1000-1350 connections.
However, we did on average, received the following value

	=> MAX Connections Before Drop = 1350

2. When Operating on this, and averaged over 5 successful runs (not always consecutive due to non determinism of Apache test framework), we received the following

	=> Requests per second = 72.50 [#/sec]

3. Under these conditions, we evaluated more metrics,

	=> Average Response Time of 1350 Requests = 13.794 ms (mean, across all concurrent requests)
	=> 99% Response Time = (Time to Serve 99% of Requests) / (0.99*1350) = 12.78 (mean, across all concurrent requests)

4. At a steady state of 1350 connections and 1350 requests, we observed the following system utilization data

	=> CPU Utilization: 	
			%CPU: 10.39%
			%user: 8.10%
			%system: 2.29%
	=> Memory Utilization:	
			MEM%: 6.59%
			Minor Faults: 69.69/s 
			Major Faults: 0/s
	=> Disk IO Utilization:	
			Reads: 0.02 kB/s
			Writes: 271.14 kB/s
			Cancelled Writes: 0 writes/s
	=> Network Utilization:		
			Sent: 335.142 kB/s
			Received: 55.42 kB/s

(Note: Steady state was simulate by running benchmark_server.py and then running the network monitoring tools
   		The values reported were the average results of those tools)
